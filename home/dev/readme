home/dev folder
-----------------
This folder will be your devtools container user $HOME directory. This doesn't not override or replace your HOST machine. We are keeping the container isolated from your machine so there is no conflicts or overwriting happening.

It will contain/persist back to your host machine user specific config files for your container user for things like:
+ .ssh/ -- if you want to use git with SSH
+ .gitconfig -- for setting git configurations for your user
+ .bash_profile -- for setting custom ENV variables for your container
+ .bash_alias -- for setting additional custom aliases for your container
